    I am currently employed as a .NET developer and database architect. I have
    the pleasure of maintaining and enhancing many company internal line of
    business systems in addition to customer facing applications. In a typical
    day I always find an opportunity to learn something new as I bounce between
    a few projects. I also enjoy leading knowledge sharing sessions between my
    team and the customer support group. As I gain more understanding in new
    and even familiar systems, I always try to look for opportunities for
    improvement. When it comes to my craft, I put a lot of emphasis in trying
    to determine what my product will be used for years down the road, beyond
    the initial requirements. I believe having that nature allows me to build
    a product that can be modified and expanded on more easily. During product
    design and development I often ask "If I had to make a change, how can I
    design the system so that I only had to change one thing", "If I add a new
    input, it should just work", and "Can the design and interface be more
    intuitive".

    Since I finished my Computer Science Bachelors degree in 2018, I have not
    been able to kick the need to study. I am always trying to learn something,
    or build something. I switched to Linux early in my degree because it was
    easier to get the tools I needed and keep them up to date. Today, I try
    to take what I have learned from Linux and evolve my workflow at home and
    at work. I have an ever growing list of projects to get to and I love how
    the list is always growing. Check out my Trello board and GitHub! In the 
    future, in addition to being a part of a software engineering group, I
    would like to be a part time professor at the college level, teaching
    programming fundamentals because I believe that the common practices today
    could be improved.
