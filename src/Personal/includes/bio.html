<h4 class="bioTagline">The big picture and the future state, simplified</h4>
<p class="bioContent">
	I am currently finishing up my first bachelor’s degree at 
	Old Dominion University [ODU], but I have not let that stop 
	me from producing software. For employment, currently I
	act as "Shadow IT", building applications and databases to
	support the Design and Engineering community for my company.
	I say that I got into software development because I wanted
	to bend computers to my will, but that is only a joke...well,
	partially a joke. When it comes to my craft, I put a lot of
	emphasis in trying to determine what my product will be used 
	for years down the 	road, beyond the initial requirements. I 
	believe having 	that nature allows me to build a product that 
	can be modified and expanded on more easily. During product 
	design and 	development I often ask “If I had to make a change,
	how can I design the system so that I only had to change one 
	thing”,	“If I add a new input, it should just work”, and “Can
	the	design and interface be more intuitive”. In the future, in 
	addition to being a part of a software engineering group, I 
	would like to be a part time professor at the college level, 
	teaching programming fundamentals because I believe that the 
	common practices today could be improved.
